        <p>
            Hello! I'm Rijan Majhi, a passionate frontend developer, designer, and artist. <br />
            I specialize in crafting intuitive user experiences and visually appealing designs. <br />
            My love for technology and creativity drives me to blend the two, creating <br />
            projects that not only look good but function seamlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me sketching, exploring new art styles, <br />
            or diving into exciting design challenges.
        </p>
